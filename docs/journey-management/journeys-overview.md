# Journeys Overview

Use Journey Optimizer to build real-time orchestration use cases using contextual data stored in events or data sources.

Design multistep advanced scenarios powered by following capabilities:

* Send real-time **unitary delivery** triggered when an event is received, or **in batch** using Adobe Experience Platform segments.
* Leverage **contextual data** from events, information from Adobe Experience Platform, or data from third-party API services.
* Use the **built-in actions** to send messages designed in Journey Optimizer or create **custom actions** if youâ€™re using a third-party system to send your messages.
* With the **journey designer**, build your multistep use cases: easily drag and drop an entry event or a read segment activity, add conditions and send personalized messages.
