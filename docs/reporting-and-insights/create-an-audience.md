# Create an Audience

Within CJA you can create an Audience from the journeys that were created. This is a great feature because it allows you to be able to use the logic that was used to create a journey then create an audience that can be shared with Experience platform to be used as any segment.

For this exercise we will create an audience of people that have placed an In Store Order so we can then send this to a Paid Media partner to exclude these users from an on-going media campaign.&#x20;

1.  Scroll down to In Store Order Journey and on the flow for In Store Orders, right click, and select Create an Audience. \

2. You will be taken to the "Create Audience" page. You need to name the audience "Order Completed Users". Everything else with be fine. Click on "Publish".

Congratulations!  You have now created an audience in CJA that can be used to share with a media partner or make it part of a Journey or use it as an offer eligibility rule.&#x20;
