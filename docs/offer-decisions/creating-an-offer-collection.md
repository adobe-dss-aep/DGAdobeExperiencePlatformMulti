# Creating an Offer Collection

{% hint style="info" %}
Offer Collections can be dynamic so any offer that has a set of specific collection qualifier labels will enter in the collection without any human intervention. Or, you can create a collection and manually add offers to it.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Create an Offer Collection

1.  Click on the tab collections.\
    &#x20;

2. Click on Create Collection. Give it a name like "summer coupon collection - Your initials"
3. Leave the option: "Create dynamic collection" and click next.&#x20;
4. Then on the left hand side, search for the collection qualifier we created earlier, and select it.&#x20;
5.  As soon as you select the right qualifier, you'll see your personalized offer show up in the list. Finally click Save. \

Next, let's create a decision.&#x20;
