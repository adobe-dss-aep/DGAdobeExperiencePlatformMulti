# Creating a Fallback offer

The fallback offer is sent to customers if they are not eligible for other offers. The steps to create a fallback offer consist in creating one or several representations that equal our personalized offer representations, like when creating an offer.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that, unlike personalized offers, fallback offers have no eligibility rules and constraint parameters, because they are presented to customers as last resorts with no condition.
{% endhint %}
